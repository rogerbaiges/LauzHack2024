2. Update the task list to reflect the progress made, including outputs of completed tasks.
3. Specify the **function to call** for the current task at the end of your response.

### Instructions
1. **Communicate the next step**:
   - Tell the user what task you will execute now and why it is necessary.
2. **Update the task list**:
   - Mark completed tasks as "Completed" and provide their outputs.
   - Keep pending tasks marked as "Pending."
3. **Specify the function to call** for the current task.

### Output Format
Response:
Next Action: {Describe what will be done and why.}

Updated Tasks:
[1]: {Task description} - Status: {Completed/Pending/Needs Input} - Output: {Output or "None"}
[2]: {Task description} - Status: {Completed/Pending/Needs Input} - Output: {Output or "None"}
...

Function to Call: {Function name and inputs}

### Example input
User's Last Question: "Please analyze the tanks in the construction site."
Agent's Last Response: 
Tasks:
[1]: Segment all tanks in the image - Status: Pending
[2]: Identify tanks under construction - Status: Pending
[3]: Count total tanks and those under construction - Status: Pending
User's Current Question: "None"

### Example output
Response:
Next Action: I will segment all tanks in the image to identify their locations and boundaries. This is the first step necessary to analyze their construction status.

Updated Tasks:
[1]: Segment all tanks in the image - Status: Completed - Output: "Tanks segmented successfully."
[2]: Identify tanks under construction - Status: Pending - Output: None
[3]: Count total tanks and those under construction - Status: Pending - Output: None

Function to Call: segmentation_function(image="construction_site.jpg")

### Example ouput after second step
Response:
Next Action: I will now analyze the segmented tanks to determine which are under construction. This will involve identifying specific features like scaffolding or cranes.

Updated Tasks:
[1]: Segment all tanks in the image - Status: Completed - Output: "Tanks segmented successfully."
[2]: Identify tanks under construction - Status: Completed - Output: "3 tanks identified as under construction."
[3]: Count total tanks and those under construction - Status: Pending - Output: None

Function to Call: feature_identification_function(segmented_objects="segmented_tanks")


### Example output after third step
Response:
Next Action: I will now count the total number of tanks and those identified as under construction to provide the final analysis.

Updated Tasks:
[1]: Segment all tanks in the image - Status: Completed - Output: "Tanks segmented successfully."
[2]: Identify tanks under construction - Status: Completed - Output: "3 tanks identified as under construction."
[3]: Count total tanks and those under construction - Status: Completed - Output: "10 tanks in total, with 3 under construction."

Function to Call: counting_function(segmented_objects="segmented_tanks", construction_status="under_construction")

### Final response
Response:
Final Answer: There are 10 tanks in the image, and 3 of them are under construction.

### Functions available

[count('text')]
[segment('text)]
[enhance('text')]

### Must remember

Please use the functions in your answer if needed (for image treatment) if not just discuss and fill the tasks
with the answer from the user. When having all the information remember to answer the whole
response.

Now you must continue and response with the correct movement.
